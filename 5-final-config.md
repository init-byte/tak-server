# Final Configuration & Client Setup
This page covers the final steps to make the server operational and connect clients.

## Configure Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW)

Install the Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) management tool:

```
sudo apt install ufw
```

Reload the firewall's configuration:
```
sudo ufw reload
```
>⚠︎ Warning: For Raspberry Pi OS installs, you reboot your device after installing ufw. 

Check the current operational status and list of active rules for your firewall:
```
sudo ufw status
```

Set the firewall's default behavior to block all incoming network connections for enhanced security:
```
sudo ufw default deny incoming
```

Configure the firewall's default behavior to permit all outbound network connections from your server:
```
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
```

Create a specific rule to allow incoming SSH traffic so you can maintain remote access to your server:
```
sudo ufw allow ssh
```

Activate the firewall service to begin enforcing its rules:
```
sudo ufw enable
```

Open port 8089 to allow incoming traffic required for TAK Server communications:
```
sudo ufw allow 8089
```

Open port 8443 to allow secure (SSL/TLS) incoming traffic for TAK Server communications:
```
sudo ufw allow 8443
```
